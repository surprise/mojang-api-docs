# Authenticating a Mojang account
**Warning: This article is DEPRECATED. Mojang is migrating existing Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts in early 2021 and won't be supporting this method of authentication anymore. This article's aim is to show how to authenticate Mojang accounts if you have one from before December 1st, 2020, when Mojang switched to Microsoft's system for all new users.**

In order to use any of the endpoints on Mojang's API that require authentication, we of course need to be authenticated. This article goes through how to authenticate a user via Mojang's `authserver`, codename Yggdrasil, to get an authorization token we can use.

Keep in mind, this endpoint is not on the main Mojang API domain, instead using `authserver.mojang.com`.

### Request
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Endpoint:** `/authenticate`
- **Full URL:** `https://authserver.mojang.com/authenticate`
- **Headers:**
    - `Content-Type: application/json`

The POST body should fit this format:

```json
{
  "agent" : {
    "name" : "Minecraft", // identifying which game is connecting
    "version" : 1
  },
  "username" : "testuser@domain.tld", // username (legacy) or email address
  "password" : "CoolPassw0rd!34^", // password
  "clientToken" : "Mojang-API-Client", // client token used to identify yourself (OPTIONAL)
  "requestUser" : "true" // request a response back containing user information
}
```

Interestingly enough, Mojang only cares about the first 72 characters of a user's password. You don't need to supply any more characters, but if you do and if you get any more characters wrong, it'll still let you in.

### Response
**200: OK**

We have successfully authenticated. Below is a sample response of what you would recieve when you are successfully authenticated:

```json
{
  "user" : { // Mojang user info
    "properties" : [ // user properties (MAY NOT BE RETURNED.)
      {
        "name" : "preferredLanguage", // which language system emails will be sent in
        "value" : "en-us" // IETF language tag
      },
      {
        "name" : "registrationCountry", // where the account was first registered
        "value" : "US" // two-letter country code
      }
    ],
    "username" : "newname34234", // Mojang account email or username (legacy)
    "id" : "2ea6d02ea02ea6e2acf579df2e2eb15f" // Mojang account identifier (userId value)
  },
  "accessToken" : "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIyZWE2ZDAyZWEwMmVhNmUyYWNmNTc5ZGYyZTJlYjE1ZiIsInlnZ3QiOiIyZWUzMmRiYjJlMzM0ODJlMmVkMWVhMmQ2MzYyMjlhOCIsInNwciI6IjMxZTBjY2JlZjVmYTRlYjk4ODU5MmYzMDUxNmY2NWZlYyIsImlzcyI6IllnZ2RyYXNpbC1BdXRoIiwiZXhwIjoxNjA3MDYyMjI1LCJpYXQiOjE2MDY4ODk0MjV9.wlo94pIG_H14rxFLYvf1UqeGXUUHItkSSfDvdqquOdI", // Bearer token

  "availableProfiles" : [ // array of available profiles (one Mojang account can have multiple Minecraft profiles on it)
    {

      "name" : "newname34234", // username of this profile
      "id" : "31e0ccbef5fa4eb988592f30516f65fe" // uuid of this profile
    }
  ],
  "selectedProfile" : { // profile info on the currently selected profile
    "legacy" : true, // if the account is not legacy, this won't show up

}
```
